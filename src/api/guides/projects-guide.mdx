This guide provides a high-level overview of how to use Sentry's API to create a new project and configure advanced settings on that project. It assumes a intermediate level of familiarity with Sentry and Sentry's APIs.

For a beginner-friendly, guided tutorial, check out the [Create and List Teams with the Sentry API](/api/guides/teams-tutorial/) tutorial.

APIs used in this guide:

- [Create a New Project](/api/projects/create-a-new-project/)
- [Update an Inbound Data Filter](/api/projects/update-an-inbound-data-filter/)
- [Update a Project](/api/projects/update-a-project/)
- [Update a Client Key](/api/projects/update-a-client-key/)
- [Add a Team to a Project](/api/projects/add-a-team-to-a-project/)

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account with an organization-level role of Admin or higher.
- A Sentry authentication token with !!TODO SHANA SCOPES!! scopes or higher.

  > If you don't have an authentication token, follow the [Create a Sentry Authentication Token](/api/guides/create-auth-token) tutorial to create an organization auth token with the following permissions, or higher:

    - !!TODO SHANA SCOPES!!
