This guide walks you through the basics of using Sentry's APIs to list the teams in an organization and create a new team.

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account with an organization-level role of <TODO SHANA> or higher

You can use a free [Sentry developer account](https://sentry.io/pricing/) for this tutorial.

## Get an Sentry Authentication Token

You must pass an authentication token along with your API calls to authenticate with Sentry. Auth tokens can be associated with a user or with an organization. We recommend using tokens associated with an organization when possible, because user tokens stop working once a user is removed from an organization.

For this guide, we will generate an organization auth token by creating an internal integration.

### Create an Internal Integration

[Internal Integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration/) can be used to create custom Sentry integrations for your organization. However, they can also be used as a tool to create and manage your organization auth tokens.

1. Open [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)

1. Press "Settings" in the left menu to open the **Organization Settings** page.

1. Press "Custom Integrations" in the left side panel to create a new internal integration and org-level auth token.

1. Press the "Create New Integration" button.

1. Make sure "Internal Integration" is selected in the modal and press "Next".

1. Enter a name for your integration.

1. Under "Permissions" select "Read & Write" in the "Organization" dropdown.

    Creating a new team requires an auth token with organization write permissions. Listing teams only requires read permissions.

1. Press "Save Changes".

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and copy the generated token under "Tokens".

    You'll need this token for all your future API calls.
