To use Sentry's APIs, you must have an authentication token. This tutorial walks you through creating an organizational authentication token associated with an internal integration, the method recommended by Sentry.

See our documentation on [authentication](/api/auth/) to learn more about the different types of authentication tokens available.

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account with an organization-level role of Admin or higher <!-- TODO SHANA confirm -->

We recommend using a free [Sentry developer account](https://sentry.io/pricing/) for this tutorial.

## Create an Internal Integration

[Internal integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration/) can be used to create custom Sentry integrations for your organization. However, they can also be used as a tool to create and manage your organization auth tokens.

1. Open [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)

1. Click "Settings" in the left menu to open the **Organization Settings** page.

1. Click "Custom Integrations" in the left side panel to create a new internal integration and org-level auth token.

1. Press the "Create New Integration" button.

1. Make sure "Internal Integration" is selected in the modal and press "Next".

1. Enter a name for your integration.

## Create a API Authentication Token

1. Under "Permissions" select the permissions required for the APIs you wish to call.

   Each API endpoint docs page lists the required permissions, in the "Scopes" section. For example, the [Create a New Project]() endpoint requires project:admin permissions.

1. Click "Save Changes".

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and copy the generated token under "Tokens".
