Intro text

## Prerequisites

- A Sentry account with an organization-level role of Admin or higher <!-- TODO SHANA confirm -->

## Get an Sentry Authentication Token

You must pass an authentication token along with your API calls to authenticate with Sentry. Auth tokens can be associated with a user or with an organization. We recommend using tokens associated with an organization when possible, because user tokens stop working once a user is removed from an organization.

For this guide, we will generate an organization auth token by creating an internal integration.

[Internal Integrations](/product/integrations/integration-platform/internal-integration/) can be used to create custom Sentry integrations for your organization. However, they can also be used as a tool to create and manage your organization auth tokens.

1. Open [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/)

1. Press "Settings" in the left menu to open the **Organization Settings** page.

1. Press "Custom Integrations" in the left side panel to create a new internal integration and org-level auth token.

1. Press the "Create New Integration" button.

1. Make sure "Internal Integration" is selected in the modal and press "Next".

1. Enter a name for your integration.

1. Under "Permissions" select TODO SHANA.

   Creating a new team requires an auth token with organization write permissions. Listing teams only requires read permissions.

1. Press "Save Changes".

1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page and copy the generated token under "Tokens".

   You'll need this token for all your future API calls.
