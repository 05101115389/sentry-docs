As described in [sampling types](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/sampling-types/) dynamic sampling
operates on transaction events, these having the ability to be sampled independently or as part of a complete trace.

To configure dynamic sampling you need to have organization owner or manager role.

<!-- This will be temporarily commented out until we enable the error rules again
The dynamic sampling configuration can be found in the project settings under "Filters & Sampling".
You can find two lists one for error rules and one for transaction rules. The transaction rules list contains
both rules for independent transactions and rules for transaction traces.

The dynamic sampling configuration can be found in the project settings under "Filters & Sampling".
There you can find a transaction list, which contains rules for independent transactions and rules for transaction traces.

Regardless of the type of rule the basic structure of the rule is the same:

<!-- This will be temporarily commented out until we enable the error rules again
* has a type that determines the event type to which it applies (Error or Transaction).
-->

* has 0 or more conditions
* has a sampling rate (in percentages)

Transaction rules are further divided in, independent transaction rules and trace transaction rules.

If a rule contains multiple conditions the conditions will have to be met simultaneously (`and` logical operation) in
order to have the rule applied.

A condition may contain multiple values to be matched, for the condition to be matched any of values must match
(`or` logical operation).

## Transaction Trace Rules

<!--  This will be temporarily commented out until we enable the error rules again
While dynamic sampling rules for errors or independent transactions have a variety of conditions that can be selected
transaction traces are a lot more limited in the information that can be used for selection.

While dynamic sampling rules for independent transactions have a variety of conditions that can be selected,
transaction traces are a lot more limited in the information that can be used for selection.

When sampling transaction traces, dynamic sampling rules are based on the transaction context.
This means that dynamic sampling decisions are based on information extracted from the system that started the transaction.
Transaction trace dynamic sampling rules are based on the following attributes,
all of which belong to the transaction that started the trace:

- Project ID
- Release
- Environment
- User segment
- Transaction name

## Rule Selection

For all rule types the selection of the appropriate rule to be executed is the same.

The system goes top to bottom through the list of rules for the type of event and tries to match the current event with
the condition in the rule, the first rule that matches is then applied.

Applying a rule means taking the associated sampling rate from the rule and making a probabilistic decision to keep or
throw the event based on the sampling rate.
