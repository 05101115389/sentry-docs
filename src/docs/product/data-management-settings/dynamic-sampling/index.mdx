Dynamic sampling allows you customize your data sample to make sure you have enough of the right kind of data to make informed decisions. For example, you have just released a new version of your application and you want to keep all transactions coming from programs running the new release, but only 10% of the transactions coming from older releases. Dynamic samplping allows you to do this without redeploying your application. With dynamic samplling you can change and manage what data is collected after your application has been deployed or published.

Dynamic sampling:

- helps you prioritize impactful data
- enables observation of complete traces
- maintains a representative sample
- requires minimal configuration and no redeployment

## Dynamic Sampling and Other Sampling Methods



## Getting Started

Quickly get up to speed and see [how to use dynamic sampling](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/getting-started/).

## Sampling Types

Sentry offers the ability to sample in two different ways:

1. [Client-side in your SDK](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/sampling/) during SDK initialization
2. [Dynamic sampling rates](./configuration/) in Filters & Sampling for your Project in sentry.io.

Learn more about our [sampling types and the benefits of each](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/sampling-types/).

## Dynamic Sampling Configuration

<!-- This will be temporarily commented out until we enable the error rules again
Dynamic sampling operates on both error events and transaction events. When creating rules for transactions, you can
further determine whether to apply dynamic sampling rules to transactions independently or as part of a trace. Learn
more about [how the rules are applied](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/configuration/).

## Examples of Dynamic Sampling

Determining which type of dynamic sampling to set varies based on what you're trying to accomplish. Review our
[comprehensive examples](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/example/) that illustrates when
different sampling methods might be useful.

## Current Implementation Status

Look at [the status of the implementation, and various implementation details](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/current-status/)
that might affect you to gain a deeper understanding of how dynamic sampling works.
