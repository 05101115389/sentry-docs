Sentry offers other ways of samplling and filtering your data. Here we explain how these methods compare to dynamic sampling.

## Dynamic Sampling and SDK Sampling

In Sentry, you can set up sampling in one of two ways:

1. Client-side, in your SDK, by [configuring the transaction sample rate](/platform-redirect/?next=/configuration/sampling/) during SDK initialization.

   This sampling approach is simple and works well in many scenarios. However, it can be difficult to change in
   scenarios where the application is distributed and redeployment is either not an option or very difficult
   (for example, in mobile applications).

2. Server-side, with dynamic sampling in the Filters & Sampling settings for your Project in sentry.io. This approach offers several benefits:

   - No need to create a new release or deployment. Update the sample rate in sentry.io, which applies immediately.
   - Holistic sample of an entire trace, as every transaction associated with the trace will be captured - from frontend to backend.

With dynamic sampling, you can add rules, sample by individual events or by entire traces. If you sample by traces, you
can sample by specific cases: release, environment, and user. Learn how to
[setup dynamic-sampling rules](/product/data-management-settings/dynamic-sampling/configuration/).

You can use both types of sampling - configuring your SDK and setting a dynamic sampling rate - in your project. If you do so, we suggest the following:

- For applications using our frontend SDKs, send all your data without configuring a sample rate on your SDK. Use dynamic sampling as your primary sampling control.
- For applications using our backend SDKs, assess the impact of tracing on your operation and keep your client-side sample rate as high as possible.

Compared with SDK sampling, dynamic sampling enables more sophisticated sampling decisions that span multiple transactions.

## Dynamic Sampling and Inbound Filters

Inbound filters are a related concept, with key differences from Dynamic Sampling.

Inbound filters may be viewed as a coarse sampling technique, where only 0% and 100% sampling rates are available.
The key difference between filters and sampling is that filters compose while sampling rules do not, the example
provides an illustration:

With two filters defined - one that removes all requests coming from Internet Explorer 9 or lower, and one that filters
requests coming from an application with release 1.* - all  events coming either from Explorer 9 or from a client
with release 1.* will be filtered out, effectively the two filters are ORed together.

With two sampling rules defined - first on release 1.* at 10%, and the second sampling on "prod1" environment
at 20% - the combined effect will not be  similar to the inbound filters case. A request coming for release 1.1 and
prod1 will match the first rule and will be sampled at 10% , a request for release 1.1 & prod2 will still match the
first rule and will be sampled at 10% while a request for release 2.1 and prod1 will match the second rule and will be
sampled at 20%.
