Sentry's Search provides you with reserved keywords, like `is`, `user`, `server`, and `browser`, that you can use to search on the properties of issues and events. You can also create [custom tags](#custom-tags) on which to search. Below are canonical lists of all available issue and event search terms.

### Issue Properties

[Issues](/product/issues/) are an aggregate of one or more events. Searchable properties include workflow status, assignment, aggregate counts, and age.

Below is a list of issue-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdown-table - START -->

| Key/Token                    | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| age | Restrict results to issues created since `age`. The syntax is similar to the Unix `find` command. Supported suffixes: `m -> minutes`, `h -> hours`, `d -> days` `w -> weeks` |
| age:-24h | Return issues that are new in the last 24 hours. |
| age:+12h | Return issues older than 12 hours. |
| age:+12h age:-24h | Return issues created between 12 and 24 hours ago. |
| assigned | Filter on the user which the issue is assigned to. Values can be a user ID (your email address), `me` for yourself, `me_or_none` for yourself or no assignee, or `#team-name`. |
| assigned_or_suggested | Filter on the user or team to which the issue is assigned or suggested to be assigned. Suggested assignees are determined by matching [ownership rules](/product/error-monitoring/issue-owners/) and [suspect commits](/product/releases/suspect-commits/). Values can be a user ID (your email address), `me` for yourself, `me_or_none` for yourself or no assignee/suggestions, or `#team-name`. |
| bookmarks | Filter on the user which the issue is bookmarked by. Values can be your user ID (your email address) or `me` for yourself. |
| first-release | Restrict results to issues first seen within the given release. Exact match on the version of a release, or `first-release:latest` to pick the most recent release. |
| has | Restrict results to issues which have _any_ value for a tag. |
| has:user | Restrict results to issues which have a user value for a tag. |
| is | Filter on various properties of an issue. |
| is:unresolved<br /> is:resolved<br /> is:ignored | Filter on the state of an issue. |
| is:assigned<br /> is:unassigned | Return issues based on whether they are are assigned or not. |
| is:linked<br /> is:unlinked | Return issues based on whether they are linked (to an external issue tracker) or not. |
| lastSeen | Restrict results to issues that were last seen since or until a given point in time. Usage is similar to the `age` token (see above). |
| lastSeen:+30d | Return issues last seen 30 days ago or more. |
| lastSeen:-2d | Return issues last seen within the last two days. |
| timesSeen | Restrict results to issues that have been seen exactly, at least, or at most some number of times.<br /><br /> An exact match token: `timesSeen:10`.<br /><br /> Upper or lower bounds tokens: `timesSeen:>10`, `timesSeen:>=10`, `timesSeen:<10`, `timesSeen:<=10` |

### Event Properties

Events are the underlying event data captured using Sentry SDKs (read: errors and transactions).

When searching on event properties within the **Issues** page, the search will return any issue that has _one or more events_ matching the supplied event filters.

Below is a list of event-level keys and tokens reserved and known to Sentry:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- markdown-table - START -->

| Key/Token                     | Description |
|---------------------------| ----------- |
| location | Restrict results to the events with a matching location. |
| message | Restrict results to events with a matching message. |
| environment | Restrict results to events tagged with the matching environment. |
| release | Restrict results to events tagged with the matching release. You can create a token with an exact match on the version of a release, or `release:latest` to pick the most recent release. |
| release.package<br /> release.version<br /> release.build | Restrict results to events tagged with the matching semantic version. Supports ranges and wildcards. Learn more in [Sorting & Filtering Releases](/product/releases/usage/sorting-filtering/). |
| release.stage | Restrict results to releases that are tagged with the matching release stage. See [Filtering Releases](/product/releases/usage/sorting-filtering/#filtering-releases) for supported values. |
| transaction | Restrict results to events tagged with a URL template/job name. |
| geo.country_code<br /> geo.region geo.city | Restrict results to events triggered by a geographic area. |
| http.method<br /> http.referer<br /> http.url | Restrict results based on the HTTP request context. |
| user.id user.email<br /> user.username<br /> user.ip | Restrict results to events affecting a given user. |
| event.timestamp | Restrict results to events that occurred at the given timestamp. This filter can be passed twice to provide a range.<br /><br /> Events occurred on January 2, 2016: `event.timestamp:2016-01-02`<br /><br /> Events between 01:00 and 02:00 (UTC): `event.timestamp:>=2016-01-02T01:00:00 event.timestamp:<2016-01-02T02:00:00`<br /><br /> The following comparative operators are available: greater than (`>`), greater than or equal (`>=`), less than (`<`), less than or equal (`<=`) |
| device.arch<br /> device.battery_level<br /> device.brand<br /> device.charging<br /> device.locale<br /> device.model_id<br /> device.name<br /> device.online<br /> device.orientation<br /> device.simulator<br /> device.uuid | Restrict results to events tagged with a specific device attribute. |
| os.build<br /> os.kernel_version | Restrict results to events tagged with a specific operating system property. |
| stack.abs_path<br /> stack.filename<br /> stack.function<br /> stack.module<br /> stack.package<br /> stack.stack_level<br /> stack.lineno | Restrict results to events with a matching stack property.<br /><br /> For Native SDK users, `stack.package` is the Native equivalent for `stack.module`. For more details about enhancing search, see the full documentation on [adding context and customizing tags](/platforms/native/enriching-events/). |
| error.type<br /> error.value<br /> error.mechanism<br /> error.handled | Restrict results to events with a matching error property. |

<!-- markdown-table - END -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Custom Tags

Additionally, you can use any tag you’ve specified as a token. Tags are various key/value pairs that get assigned to an event, and you can use them later as a breakdown or quick access to finding related events.

Most SDKs generally support configuring tags by <PlatformLink to="/enriching-events/tags/">configuring the scope</PlatformLink>.

Several common uses for tags include:

- The hostname of the server
- The version of your platform (for example, iOS 5.0)
- The user’s language

Things to know:
Search terms should auto-complete, and when they don't that means you have an invalid data set. If you complete the term and hit enter, an error message is displayed. For example, in Discover, you cannot search using a grouping function if you don't already have a grouping function in your Results table columns.
Default parameters in search functions can be updated.

- Discover, Performance = events
- Issues = issues
- Releases = it’s own beast
- Dashboards within the widget builder = issues & events & releases
- Projects and Environment are sometimes dropdown filters
