<ConfigKey name="async" deprecated={true}>

By default, `sentry-ruby` sends events asynchronously with its own background worker. This option only exists for compatibility reasons, and it's not recommended to new Sentry users.

For more information on the deprecation reasons, please read [this issue](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-ruby/issues/1522).
