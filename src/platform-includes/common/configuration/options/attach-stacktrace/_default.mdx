<ConfigKey name="attach-stacktrace">

When enabled, stack traces are automatically attached to all messages logged. Stack traces are always attached to exceptions; however, when this option is set, stack traces are also sent with messages. This option, for instance, means that stack traces appear next to all log messages.

<PlatformSection supported={["android", "apple", "java"]}>

This option is turned on by default.

</PlatformSection>
<PlatformSection notSupported={["android", "apple", "java", "dotnet"]}>

This option is turned off by default.

</PlatformSection>

Grouping in Sentry is different for events with stack traces and without. As a result, you will get new groups as you enable or disable this flag for certain events.
