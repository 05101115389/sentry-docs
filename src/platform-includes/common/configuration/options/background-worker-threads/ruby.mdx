<ConfigKey name="background-worker-threads">

If `config.async` isn't provided, Sentry will send events in a non-blocking way with its own background worker. By default, the worker holds a thread pool that has [the number of processors] threads. But you can configure it with this configuration option:

```ruby
config.background_worker_threads = 5
```

Or if you want to send events synchronously, set the value to `0`:

```ruby
config.background_worker_threads = 0
```

</ConfigKey>
