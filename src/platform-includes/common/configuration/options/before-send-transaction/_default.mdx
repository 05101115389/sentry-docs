<ConfigKey name="before-send-transaction" supported={["javascript", "node", "php", "go", "python", "java"]}>

This function is called with an SDK-specific transaction event object, and can return a modified transaction event object, or `null` to skip reporting the event. One way this might be used is for manual PII stripping before sending.
