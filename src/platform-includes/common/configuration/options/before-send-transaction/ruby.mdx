<ConfigKey name="before-send-transaction">

Provide a lambda or proc. This will be `called` before sending a transaction event to Sentry. It receives an `event` and `hint` as a parameter. The `hint` object is currently empty, but might be augmented in the future. It's possible to mutate the event. Also, if this function returns `nil`, the event will be dropped and not sent.

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  # ...
  config.before_send_transaction = lambda do |event, _hint|
    # skip unimportant transactions
    if event.transaction == "/unimportant/healthcheck/route"
      # don't send the event to Sentry
      nil
    else
      # filter out SQL queries from spans with sensitive data
      event.spans.each do |span|
        span[:description] = '<FILTERED>' if span[:op].start_with?('db')
      end

      event
    end
  end
end
```

</ConfigKey>
