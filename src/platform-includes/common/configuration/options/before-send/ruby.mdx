<ConfigKey name="before-send">

Provide a lambda or proc. This will be `called` before sending an error event to Sentry. Receives an `event` and `hint` as parameter. `hint` is a dict `{:exception => ex | nil, :message => message | nil}`. It is possible to mutate the event, also if this function returns `nil` the event will be dropped and not sent.
