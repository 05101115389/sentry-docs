<ConfigKey name="breadcrumbs-logger">

Sentry supports different breadcrumbs loggers in the Ruby SDK:

- `:sentry_logger` - A general breadcrumbs logger for all Ruby applications.
- `:active_support_logger` - Built on top of [ActiveSupport instrumentation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html) and provides many Rails-specific information.
- `:monotonic_active_support_logger` - Similar to `:active_support_logger` but breadcrumbs will have monotonic time values. Only available with Rails 6.1+.
- `:http_logger` - It captures requests made with the standard `net/http` library.

And you can enable them with the `breadcrumbs_logger` option:

```ruby
config.breadcrumbs_logger = [:active_support_logger]
config.breadcrumbs_logger = [:active_support_logger, :http_logger]
```
