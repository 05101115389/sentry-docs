<ConfigKey name="consider-in-app-frames-by-default" supported={["dart"]}>

Configures whether stack trace frames are considered as in app frames by default.
You can use this to essentially make `inAppIncludes` or `inAppExcludes` an allow or deny list.
This value is used only if Sentry can not find the origin of the frame.

- If `considerInAppFramesByDefault` is set to `true`, you only need to maintain `inAppExcludes`.
- Conversely, if `considerInAppFramesByDefault` is set to `false`, you only need to maintain `inAppIncludes`.
