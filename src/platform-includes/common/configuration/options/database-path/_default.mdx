<ConfigKey name="database-path" supported={["native"]}>

Allows you to specify a path to the local event- and crash-database of the Native SDK. This path will default to `.sentry-native` relative to the current working directory (`CWD`). While this is a convenient setting for development, we strongly urge you to provide an explicit database path for our production deployments. In many deployment scenarios, the path relative to the `CWD` will not be writable. For this reason, you should store the database in your application's user-specific data/cache directory (e.g., under `%AppData%\Local` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support` on macOS, or `XDG_CACHE_HOME` on Linux).
