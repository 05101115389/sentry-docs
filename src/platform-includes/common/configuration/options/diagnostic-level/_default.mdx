<ConfigKey name="diagnostic-level" supported={["dotnet", "java", "android", "dart", "flutter", "apple"]}>

Enabling `debug` mode makes the SDK generate as much diagnostic data as possible. However, if you'd prefer to lower the verbosity of the Sentry SDK diagnostics logs, configure this option to set the appropriate level:

- `debug`: **default** The most verbose mode
- `info`: Informational messages
- `warning`: Warning that something might not be right
- `error`: Only SDK internal errors are printed
- `fatal`: Only critical errors are printed

<PlatformSection supported={["dotnet"]}>

For app models that don't have a console to print to, you can <PlatformLink to="/configuration/diagnostic-logger/">customize the SDK's diagnostic logger</PlatformLink> to write to a file or to Visual Studio's debug window.
