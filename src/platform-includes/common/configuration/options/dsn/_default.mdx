<ConfigKey name="dsn">

The _DSN_ tells the SDK where to send the events. If this value is not provided, the SDK will try to read it from the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable. If that variable also does not exist, the SDK will just not send any events.

In runtimes without a process environment (such as the browser) that fallback does not apply.
