<ConfigKey name="enable-backpressure-handling" supported={["python"]}>

When enabled, a new monitor thread will be spawned to perform health checks on the SDK. If the system is unhealthy, the SDK will keep halving the `traces_sample_rate` set by you in 10 second intervals until recovery. This downsampling helps ensure that the system stays stable and reduces SDK overhead under high load.

This option is enabled by default.
