<ConfigKey name="enable-native-crash-handling" supported={["react-native", "javascript.capacitor", "flutter"]}>

  Set this boolean to `false` to disable hard crash handling from the native layer. Doing so means that the SDK won't capture events for hard crashes on Android and iOS if the error was caused by native code.
