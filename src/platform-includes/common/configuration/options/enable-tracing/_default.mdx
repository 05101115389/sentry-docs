<ConfigKey name="enable-tracing" supported={["apple", "node", "javascript", "python", "php", "dotnet", "java", "ruby", "go", "react-native", "android", "dart"]}>

A boolean value, if `true`, transactions and trace data will be generated and captured. Internally, this will set the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> to `1.0`, meaning all transactions will be sent. If you set the value to `false`, performance monitoring will be disabled.

Note that <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> take precedence over this option. Meaning if you deactivate <PlatformIdentifier name="enable-tracing" /> but configure a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> of `0.5`, performance monitoring will be activated and 50% of all transactions will be sent to Sentry.
