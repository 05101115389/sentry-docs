<ConfigKey name="enabled-environments">

As of v0.10.0, events will be sent to Sentry in all environments. If you do not wish to send events in an environment, we suggest you unset the `SENTRY_DSN` variable in that environment.

Alternately, you can configure Sentry to run only in certain environments by configuring the `enabled_environments` list. For example, to only run Sentry in production:

```ruby
config.enabled_environments = %w[production]
```

</ConfigKey>
