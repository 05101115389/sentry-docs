<ConfigKey name="enabled" supported={["javascript", "node", "java"]}>

  Specifies whether this SDK should send events to Sentry. Defaults to `true`. Setting this to `enabled: false` doesn't prevent all overhead from Sentry instrumentation. To disable Sentry completely, depending on environment, call `Sentry.init` conditionally.
