<ConfigKey name="environment">

  Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

  By default, the SDK reports `debug` when the debugger is attached. Otherwise, the default environment is `production`.

  Additionally, if you are running with the ASP.NET Core integration, you will also see the environment named as `staging`, if running in staging, or `development`, if running in development mode.
