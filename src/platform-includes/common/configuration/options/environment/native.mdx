<ConfigKey name="environment">

Sets the environment. This string is freeform and set by default. A release can be associated with more than one environment to separate them in the UI (think `staging` vs `prod` or similar).

By default the SDK will try to read this value from the `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable. Otherwise, the default environment is `production`.
