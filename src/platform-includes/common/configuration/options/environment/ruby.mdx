<ConfigKey name="environment">

Sentry automatically sets the current environment to `RAILS_ENV`, or if it is not present, `RACK_ENV`. If you are using Sentry outside of Rack or Rails, or wish to override environment detection, youâ€™ll need to set the current environment by setting `SENTRY_CURRENT_ENV` or configuring the client yourself:

<PlatformContent includePath="common/usage/events/enriching-events/environment" />
