<ConfigKey name="excluded-exceptions">

If you never wish to be notified of certain exceptions, specify `excluded_exceptions` in your config file.

In the example below, the exceptions Rails uses to generate 404 responses will be suppressed.

```ruby
config.excluded_exceptions += ['ActionController::RoutingError', 'ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound']
```

You can find the list of exceptions that are excluded by default in `Sentry::Configuration::IGNORE_DEFAULT`. It is suggested that you append to these defaults rather than overwrite them with `=`.
