<ConfigKey name="functions-to-trace" supported={["python"]}>

An optional list of functions that should be set up for performance monitoring. For each function in the list, a span will be created when the function is executed.
Functions in the list are represented as strings containing the fully qualified name of the function.

This is a convenient option, making it possible to have one central place for configuring what functions to trace, instead of having custom instrumentation scattered all over your code base.

To learn more, see the [Custom Instrumentation](/platforms/python/performance/instrumentation/custom-instrumentation/#define-span-creation-in-a-central-place) documentation.
