<ConfigKey name="http-proxy" supported={["php", "python", "java", "dotnet", "rust"]}>

When set, a proxy can be configured that should be used for outbound requests. This is also used for HTTPS requests unless a separate `https-proxy` is configured. However, not all SDKs support a separate HTTPS proxy. SDKs will attempt to default to the system-wide configured proxy, if possible. For instance, on Unix systems, the `http_proxy` environment variable will be picked up.
