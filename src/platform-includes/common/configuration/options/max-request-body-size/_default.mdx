<ConfigKey name="max-request-body-size" supported={["php", "dotnet.aspnet", "dotnet.aspnetcore", "java", "python"]}>

This parameter controls whether integrations should capture HTTP request bodies. It can be set to one of the following values:

- `never`: Request bodies are never sent.
- `small`: Only small request bodies will be captured. The cutoff for small depends on the SDK (typically 4KB).
- `medium`: Medium and small requests will be captured (typically 10KB).
- `always`: The SDK will always capture the request body as long as Sentry can make sense of it.
