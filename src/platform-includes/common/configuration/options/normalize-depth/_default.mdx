<ConfigKey name="normalize-depth" supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

Sentry SDKs normalize any contextual data to a given depth. Any data beyond this depth will be trimmed and marked using its type instead (`[Object]` or `[Array]`), without walking the tree any further. By default, walking is performed three levels deep.
