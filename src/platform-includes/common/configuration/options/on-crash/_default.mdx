<ConfigKey name="on-crash" supported={["native"]}>

This function is called with a backend-specific event object, and can return a modified event object or nothing to skip reporting the event. In contrast to `before_send`, it is only called when a crash occurred. You can find detailed information concerning its usage in <PlatformLink to={'/usage/events/filtering-events/#using-on_crash'}>filtering events</PlatformLink>.
