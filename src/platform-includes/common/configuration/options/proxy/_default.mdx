<ConfigKey name="proxy" supported={["native"]}>
  Configures an HTTP proxy for outgoing requests to the backend, (HTTPS requests
  tunneled through that proxy). The Native SDK doesn't pick up the `http_proxy`
  environment variable. You can find more details on the [transport
  page](/platforms/native/configuration/transports/#using-an-http-proxy).
