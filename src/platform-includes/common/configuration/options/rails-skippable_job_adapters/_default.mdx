<ConfigKey name="rails.skippable_job_adapters" supported={["ruby"]}>

If you don't want to report events from a certain ActiveJob adapter, or you already have a better setup for it, you can use this option to skip ActiveJob reporting on that adapter.

```ruby
config.rails.skippable_job_adapters = ["ActiveJob::QueueAdapters::MyAdapter"]
```

</ConfigKey>
