<ConfigKey name="release">

Track the version of your application in Sentry. If the release is not provided via configuration, we try to guess it in the following order of preference:

- Commit SHA of the last commit (git)
- Reading from the REVISION file in the app root
- Herokuâ€™s dyno metadata (must have enabled via Heroku Labs)
