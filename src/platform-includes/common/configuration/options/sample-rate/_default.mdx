<ConfigKey name="sample-rate">

Configures the sample rate for error events, in the range of `0.0` to `1.0`. The default is `1.0` which means that 100% of error events are sent. If set to `0.1` only 10% of error events will be sent. Events are picked randomly.

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

```ruby
# send 50% of events
config.sample_rate = 0.5
```
