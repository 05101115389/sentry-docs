Sensitive information includes user IP addresses, user cookies, request bodies and the query string in URLs. By default, no such data is sent to Sentry.

If you enable this flag, certain personally identifiable information (PII) is added by active integrations. Be sure to manually remove what you don't want to send using our features for managing [_Sensitive Data_](../../data-management/sensitive-data/).

<PlatformSection supported={["ruby"]}>

```ruby
config.send_default_pii = true
```

If you are using Sentry in your mobile app, read our [frequently asked questions about mobile data privacy](/product/security/mobile-privacy/) to assist with Apple App Store and Google Play app privacy details.
