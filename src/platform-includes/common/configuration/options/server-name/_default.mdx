This option can be used to supply a "server name." When provided, the name of the server is sent along and persisted in the event. For many integrations, the server name actually corresponds to the device hostname, even in situations where the machine is not actually a server.

For ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core applications, the value will default to the server's name. For other application types, the value will default to the computer's name only when the `SendDefaultPii` is set to `true`, because the computer's name can be considered personally identifiable information (PII) in the case of a desktop or mobile application.
