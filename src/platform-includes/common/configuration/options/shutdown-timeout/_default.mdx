<ConfigKey name="shutdown-timeout" supported={["python", "node", "java", "dotnet", "rust", "react-native", "javascript.capacitor"]}>

  Controls how many seconds to wait before shutting down. Sentry SDKs send events from a background queue. This queue is given a certain amount to drain pending events. The default is SDK specific but typically around two seconds. Setting this value too low may cause problems for sending events from command line applications. Setting the value too high will cause the application to block for a long time for users experiencing network connectivity problems.
