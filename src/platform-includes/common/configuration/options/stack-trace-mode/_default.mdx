- Original - Default .NET stack trace format.
- Enhanced - Include `async`, return type, arguments, and more.

Before version 3.0.0 of the Sentry SDK for .NET, there was no special treatment for the stack trace. Sentry reported what .NET made available at runtime.
This behavior now called `StackTraceMode.Original`. With the introduction of 3.0, a new default mode is `Enhanced`.
