<ConfigKey name="trace-options-requests" supported={["java"]}>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable tracing for `OPTIONS` requests. This options default value will likely be changed in the next major version, meaning you will have to set it to `true` if you want to keep tracing `OPTIONS` requests.
