<ConfigKey name="traces-sample-rate">

A number between `0.0` and `1.0`, controlling the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. (`0.0` or `nil` represents 0% while `1.0` represents 100%.) Applies equally to all transactions created in the app.

Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> must be defined to enable tracing.
