<ConfigKey name="traces-sampler" supported={["apple", "node", "javascript", "python", "php", "dotnet", "java", "ruby", "go", "react-native", "android", "dotnet", "dart"]} notSupported={["native"]}>

A function responsible for determining the percentage chance a given transaction will be sent to Sentry. It will automatically be passed information about the transaction and the context in which it's being created, and must return a number between `0` (0% chance of being sent) and `1` (100% chance of being sent). Can also be used for filtering transactions, by returning 0 for those that are unwanted. Either this or <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> must be defined to enable tracing.
