<ConfigKey name="transport-class" supported={["ruby"]}>

By default, the SDK uses `Sentry::HTTPTransport` class for sending events to Sentry, which should work for the majority of users. But if you want to use your own Transport class, you can change it with this option:

```ruby
config.transport.transport_class = MyTransportClass
```

</ConfigKey>
