### `ip_address`

The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user.
Serverside SDKs that instrument incoming requests will attempt to pull the IP address from the HTTP request data (`request.env.REMOTE_ADDR` field in JSON), if available. <PlatformSection notSupported={["javascript", "node"]}>That might require <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> set to `true` in the SDK options.</PlatformSection><PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>This requires you to set the `include.ip` option to `true` in the [`RequestData`](/platforms/node/guides/connect/configuration/integrations/default-integrations/#requestdata) integration.</PlatformSection>

If the user's `ip_address` is set to `"{{auto}}"`, Sentry will infer the IP address from the connection between your app and Sentry's server. <PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>Due to backward compatibility concerns, Sentry sets the IP address to `"{{auto}}"` out of the box for Apple. Therefore, setting <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> to `false` won't stop Sentry from collecting users' IP addresses via the client connection. Read the paragraphs below to find out how to opt out of collecting users' IP addresses.</PlatformSection>

If the field is omitted, the default value is `null`. However, due to backwards compatibility concerns, certain platforms (in particular JavaScript) have a different default value for `"{{auto}}"`. SDKs and other clients should not rely on this behavior and should set IP addresses or `"{{auto}}"` explicitly.

To opt out of storing users' IP addresses in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data](/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/) scrubbing to remove `ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.
