### `ip_address`

The user's IP address. If the user is unauthenticated, Sentry uses the IP address as a unique identifier for the user.
Serverside SDKs that instrument incoming requests will attempt to pull the IP address from the HTTP request data (`request.env.REMOTE_ADDR` field in JSON), if available. That might require <PlatformIdentifier name="send-default-pii" /> set to `true` in the SDK options.

To opt out of storing users' IP addresses in your event data, you can go to your project settings, click on "Security & Privacy", and enable "Prevent Storing of IP Addresses" or use Sentry's [server-side data](/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/) scrubbing to remove `ip_address`. Adding such a rule ultimately overrules any other logic.
