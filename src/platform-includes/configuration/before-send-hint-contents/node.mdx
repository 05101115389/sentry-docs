`originalException`

: The original exception that caused the Sentry SDK to create the event. This is useful for changing how the Sentry SDK groups events or to extract additional information. Available in error events.

`syntheticException`

: When a string or a non-error object is raised, Sentry creates a synthetic exception so you can get a basic stack trace. This exception is stored here for further data extraction. Available in error events.

`captureContext`

: Additional scope data passed as a second parameter to `captureMessage` and a third parameter to `captureException` and `captureEvent`. Available in message and error events.

`attachments`

: Files to be attached to the outgoing event. Available in message and error events.

Custom Data
