## Experimental Features

<ConfigKey name="experimental">

An optional property that configures which features are in experimental mode. This property is either an `Object Type` with properties or a key/value `TypedDict`, depending the language. Experimental features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</ConfigKey>

## Hybrid SDK Options

<ConfigKey name="enableNative">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the native SDK. This will disable all native crash and error handling and, instead, the SDK will only capture errors on the upper layer.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="autoInitializeNativeSdk">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the auto initialization of the native layer SDK. Doing so means you will need to initialize the native SDK manually. Do not use this to disable the native layer.

To disable the native layer, use [enableNative](#enableNative).

You should follow the [guide to native initialization](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/native-init/) if you chose to use this option.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNativeCrashHandling">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable hard crash handling from the native layer. Doing so means that the SDK won't capture events for hard crashes on Android and iOS if the error was caused by native code.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNativeNagger">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the native nagger alert being shown.

</ConfigKey>

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the [release health](/product/releases/health/) feature.

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="sessionTrackingIntervalMillis">

</ConfigKey>

<ConfigKey name="enableNdkScopeSync">

Set this boolean to `false` to disable the scope sync from Java to NDK on Android.

</ConfigKey>
