## Filtering Transaction Events

To prevent certain transactions from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> or <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current transaction and drop it if it's not one you want.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" />

**Note:** The <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> config options are mutually exclusive. If you define a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to filter out certain transactions, you must also handle the case of non-filtered transactions by returning the rate at which you'd like them sampled.

In its simplest form, used just for filtering the transaction, it looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-filter" />

It also allows you to sample different transactions at different rates.

If the transaction currently being processed has a parent transaction (from an upstream service calling this service), the parent (upstream) sampling decision will always be included in the sampling context data, so that your <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> can choose whether and when to inherit that decision. In most cases, inheritance is the right choice, to avoid breaking distributed traces. A broken trace will not include all your services. See <PlatformLink to="/configuration/sampling/#inheritance">Inheriting the parent sampling decision</PlatformLink> to learn more.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send-transaction" />

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-transaction" />

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-transactions" />

You can use the <PlatformIdentifier name="ignore-transactions" /> option to filter out transactions that match a certain pattern. This option receives a list of strings and regular expressions to match against the transaction name. When using strings, partial matches will be filtered out, so if you need to filter by exact match, use regex patterns instead.
