If you're using the current version of our Next.js SDK, distributed tracing will work out of the box for the client, server, and edge runtimes.

To get around possible [Browser CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) issues, please define `tracePropagationTargets` in your client config. This will prevent the SDK from adding headers to requests, that would otherwise result in a CORS error.

```js {filename:sentry.client.config.js}
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  integrations: [new Sentry.BrowserTracing()],
  tracePropagationTargets: ["https://myproject.org", /^\/api\//]
});
```

<Note>

If you're using version `7.57.x` or below, you'll need to have our <PlatformLink to="/performance/">performance monitoring</PlatformLink> feature enabled in order for distributed tracing to work.
