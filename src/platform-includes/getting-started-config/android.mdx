Here, you'll also be able to set context data, which includes data about the <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/user/">user</PlatformLink>, <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink>, all of which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.
