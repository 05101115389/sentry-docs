To complete your configuration, add <PlatformLink to="/configuration/options/">options</PlatformLink> to your `Sentry.init()` calls.
Here you can also set context data - data about the <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/user/">user</PlatformLink>, for example, or <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/tags/">tags</PlatformLink>, or even <PlatformLink to="/usage/events/enriching-events/context/">arbitrary data</PlatformLink> - which will be added to every event sent to Sentry.
