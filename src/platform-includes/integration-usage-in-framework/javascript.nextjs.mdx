## Integration Usage In Next.js

Next.js can operate within three runtimes: the Node.js runtime, the browser runtime, and the Edge runtime.
However, it's important to note that not all integrations are compatible with all of these runtimes.

Depending on whether an integration enhances the functionality of a particular runtime, such as the BrowserTracing integration for the browser runtime or the RequestData integration for the Node.js runtime, you can only include these integrations in their respective configuration files:

- For the browser runtime, add integrations to `sentry.client.config.ts`.
- For Node.js, add integrations to `sentry.server.config.ts`.
- For the Edge runtime, add integrations to `sentry.edge.config.ts`.
