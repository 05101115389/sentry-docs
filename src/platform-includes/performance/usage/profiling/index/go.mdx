<Note>

Go Profiling is currently in `alpha`. Alpha features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
Go Profiling alpha is available since SDK version `0.22.0`.

</Note>

## Configure

To enable profiling, set the `ProfilesSampleRate`:

<SignInNote />

```go
err := sentry.Init(sentry.ClientOptions{
  Dsn: "___PUBLIC_DSN___",
  EnableTracing: true,

  // We recommend adjusting these values in production:
  TracesSampleRate: 1.0,

  // The sampling rate for profiling is relative to TracesSampleRate:
  ProfilesSampleRate: 1.0,
})
```
