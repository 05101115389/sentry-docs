<Note>

Profiling for React Native is available in beta in SDK versions `5.8.0` and above. Currently, it supports profiling the JavaScript layer. Combined profiling with native Android/iOS layers isn't supported at this time.

React Native Profiling is currently in `beta`. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

## Configure

To enable profiling, set the `profilesSampleRate`:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  dsn: "___DSN___",
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0,
  _experiments: {
    // profilesSampleRate is relative to tracesSampleRate.
    // Here, we'll capture profiles for 100% of transactions.
    profilesSampleRate: 1.0
  }
});
```
