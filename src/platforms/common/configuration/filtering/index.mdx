Adding Sentry to your app gives you a great deal of very valuable information about errors and performance you wouldn't otherwise get. And lots of information is good -- as long as it's the right information, at a reasonable volume.

The Sentry SDKs have several configuration options to help you filter out events.

We also offer [Inbound Filters](/product/data-management-settings/filtering/) to filter events in sentry.io. We recommend filtering at the client level though, because it removes the overhead of sending events you don't actually want. Learn more about the [fields available in an event](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/event-payloads/).

## Filtering Error Events

You can configure your SDK to filter events in a number of ways:

- by using the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method
- by using event processors,
- by configuring, enabling, or disabling integrations.

### Using <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" />

All Sentry SDKs support the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback method. <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> is called immediately before the event is sent to the server, so it's the final place you can edit an event's data. It receives the event object as a parameter, which you can use to modify the event's data or to drop the event completely (by returning `null`) based on custom logic and the data available on the event.

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send" />

Note also that breadcrumbs can be filtered, as discussed in [our Breadcrumbs documentation](/product/error-monitoring/breadcrumbs/).

### Hints

Both event processors and the <PlatformIdentifier name="before-send" /> callback are passed two parameters: the event object and a second argument, `hint`, which holds extra data about the event. Similarly, <PlatformIdentifier name="before-breadcrumb" /> is passed the breadcrumb and a `hint` object.

When the SDK creates an event or breadcrumb, it's typically created from some sort of source object. For instance, a message event is typically created from a log record and an error event is typically created from an exception instance. Breadcrumbs may be created from XHR requests or user interactions. For better customization, SDKs pass these objects - the message which was logged, the exception which was thrown, the XHR request object, the DOM element and event name, etc. - in the hint.

For example, for error events, `hint` holds the original exception so that additional data can be extracted or grouping behavior can be modified.

In the snippet below, the event is conditionally dropped based on data in the hint:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-hint" />

In this snippet, the fingerprint is forced to a common value if an exception of a certain type has been caught:

<PlatformContent includePath="configuration/before-send-fingerprint" />

To see the properties available in the `hint` object, see <PlatformLink to="/configuration/filtering/hint-contents">Hints</PlatformLink>.

### Filtering by Script URL, Error Message, or Logger

Depending on the SDK, you may be able to filter events automatically based on certain criteria.

## Using Sampling to Filter Transaction Events

To prevent certain transactions from being reported to Sentry, use the <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> configuration option, which allows you to provide a function to evaluate the current transaction and drop it if it's not one you want. (It also allows you to sample different transactions at different rates.)

**Note:** The <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> and <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sample-rate" /> config options are mutually exclusive. If you define a <PlatformIdentifier name="traces-sampler" /> to filter out certain transactions, you must also handle the case of non-filtered transactions by returning the rate at which you'd like them sampled.

In its simplest form, used just for filtering the transaction, it looks like this:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/traces-sampler-as-filter" />
