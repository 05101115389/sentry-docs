## Group Transactions

When Sentry captures transactions, they are assigned a transaction name. This name is generally auto-generated by the Sentry SDK based on the framework integrations you are using. If you can't leverage the automatic transaction generation (or want to customize how transaction names are generated) you can use a global event processor that is registered when you initialize the SDK with your configuration.

For example:

<PlatformContent includePath="performance/group-transaction-example" />

</PlatformSection>
