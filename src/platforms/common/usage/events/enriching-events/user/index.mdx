description: "Learn how to configure the SDK to capture the user and gain critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry."
---

Users consist of a few critical pieces of information that construct a unique identity in Sentry. Each of these is optional, but one **must** be present for the Sentry SDK to capture the user:

<DefinitionList>

<PlatformSection notSupported={["apple"]}>

### `id`

<PlatformSection notSupported={["java"]} supported={["android"]}>

<Note>

If you don't provide an `id`, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.

</Note>

</PlatformSection>

Your internal identifier for the user.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["apple"]}>

### `userId`

<Note>

If you don't provide a `userId`, the SDK falls back to `installationId`, which the SDK randomly generates once during an app's installation.

</Note>

Your internal identifier for the user.

</PlatformSection>

### `username`

The username. Typically used as a better label than the internal id.

<PlatformSection supported={["go", "dart"]}>

### `name`

The user's first and/or last name.

</PlatformSection>

### `email`

An alternative, or addition, to the username. Sentry is aware of email addresses and can display things such as Gravatars and unlock messaging capabilities.

<PlatformSection supported={["apple", "dotnet", "java", "javascript", "dart", "react-native", "php", "go"]}>

### `segment`

The user segment, for apps that divide users in user segments.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformContent includePath="common/usage/events/enriching-events/user/ip-address" />

</DefinitionList>

Additionally, you can provide arbitrary key/value pairs beyond the reserved names, and the Sentry SDK will store those with the user.

<PlatformSection supported={["react-native"]}>

By default, we don't apply the user identification provided to the SDK via the API. Instead, we use the installation ID generated with the first use of the application. The ID doesn't contain any private or public data of your users or any public or shared data of their device.

</PlatformSection>

<PlatformSection supported={["javascript", "node"]}>

You'll first need to import the SDK, as usual:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/import" />

</PlatformSection>

To identify the user:

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/set-user" />

<PlatformContent includePath="enriching-events/unset-user">

You can also clear the currently set user:
