<Note>

Sentry's Dart SDK enables automatic reporting of errors, messages, and exceptions. The SDK is available on GitHub [`sentry-dart`](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-dart/). For Flutter apps, refer to [our Flutter documentation](/platforms/flutter) instead.

</Note>

**Features:**

- Breadcrumbs automatically captured:
- by the [Dart SDK](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/breadcrumbs/#automatic-breadcrumbs)
- by the [Logging Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/logging)
- by the [Dio Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/)
- [Attachments](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/attachments/) enrich your event by storing additional files, such as config or log files.
- [User Feedback](/platforms/dart/enriching-events/user-feedback/) provides the ability to collect user information when an event occurs.
- [Performance Monitoring](/product/performance/) creates transactions for:
- [HTTP requests](/platforms/dart/integrations/http-integration/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests)
- [Dio HTTP library](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/#performance-monitoring-for-http-requests)
- [File I/O Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/file/)
- [Logging Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/logging)
- [Dio Integration](/platforms/dart/integrations/dio/)

On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's SDK.

Don't already have an account and Sentry project established? Head over to [sentry.io](https://sentry.io/signup/), then return to this page.

## Install

Sentry captures data by using an SDK within your applicationâ€™s runtime.

```yml {filename:pubspec.yaml}
dependencies:
  sentry: ^{{@inject packages.version('sentry.dart') }}
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

<SignInNote />

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  await Sentry.init((options) {
      options.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___';
      // Set tracesSampleRate to 1.0 to capture 100% of transactions for performance monitoring.
      // We recommend adjusting this value in production.
      options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    });

  // or define SENTRY_DSN via Dart environment variable (--dart-define)
}
```

You can configure the `SENTRY_DSN`, `SENTRY_RELEASE`, `SENTRY_DIST`, and `SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` via the Dart environment variables passing the `--dart-define` flag to the compiler, as noted in the code sample.

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up.

```dart
import 'package:sentry/sentry.dart';

try {
  aMethodThatMightFail();
} catch (exception, stackTrace) {
  await Sentry.captureException(
    exception,
    stackTrace: stackTrace,
  );
}
```

<Note>

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.

</Note>

To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.
