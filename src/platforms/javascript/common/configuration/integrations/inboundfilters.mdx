_Import name: `Sentry.Integrations.InboundFilters`_

This integration is [enabled by default](./../#modifying-default-integrations).

This integration allows you to ignore specific errors based on the type,
message, or URLs in a given exception.

By default, it'll ignore errors that start with `Script error` or `Javascript error: Script error`.

To configure this integration, use the `ignoreErrors`, `ignoreTransactions`, `denyUrls`,
and `allowUrls` SDK options directly. For example:

```javascript
Sentry.init({
  ignoreErrors: ["ignore-this-error"],
});
```

## Options

<Note>
  Remember to pass these options to the root Sentry.init call, not the
  integration!
