This page will outline how to migrate your applications between major versions of the Sentry SDK from version 6 onwards.

## From 6.x to 7.x

The main goal of version 7 is to reduce bundle size. This version is breaking because we removed deprecated APIs, upgraded our build tooling, and restructured npm package contents.
Below we will outline all the breaking changes you should consider when upgrading.

### Moving To ES6 For CommonJS Files

The JavaScript world is moving forward, and so are we. From version 7 onwards the CommonJS files in Sentry JavaScript SDK packages will use ES6.

If you need to support Internet Explorer 11 or old Node.js versions, we recommend using a preprocessing tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to convert Sentry packages to ES5.

### Dropping Support for Node.js v6

Node.js version 6 has reached end of life in April 2019. For Sentry JavaScript SDK version 7, we will no longer be supporting version 6 of Node.js.

As far as SDK development goes, dropping support means no longer running integration tests for Node.js version 6, and also no longer handling edge cases specific to version 6.
Running the new SDK version on Node.js v6 is therefore highly discouraged.

### Removal Of Old Platform Integrations From `@sentry/integrations` Package

The following classes will be removed from the `@sentry/integrations` package and can no longer be used:

- `Angular`
- `Ember`
- `Vue`

These classes have been superseded and were moved into their own packages, `@sentry/angular`, `@sentry/ember`, and `@sentry/vue` in a previous version.
Refer to those packages if you want to integrate Sentry into your Angular, Ember, or Vue application.

### Restructuring Of Package Content

Up until now, we have published our packages on npm with the following structure:

- `build` folder contained CDN bundles
- `dist` folder contained CommonJS files and TypeScript declarations
- `esm` folder contained ESM files and TypeScript declarations

Moving forward the JavaScript SDK packages will generally have the following structure:

- `cjs` folder contains CommonJS files
- `esm` folder contains ESM files
- `types` folder contains TypeScript declarations

**CDN bundles of version 7 or higher will no longer be distributed through our npm package.**
This means that most third-party CDNs like [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) or [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) will also not provide them.

If you depend on any specific files in a Sentry JavaScript npm package, you will most likely need to update their references.
