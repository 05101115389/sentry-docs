<Note>

Browser Profiling is currently in beta. Beta features are still in progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.

</Note>

Because our JavaScript browser profiling integration is built on top of the profiler exposed by the [JS Self-Profiling API](https://wicg.github.io/js-self-profiling/), it's in beta and will likely only move out once the official spec progresses and gains adoption. As with any beta package, there are risks involved in using it. See platform [status](https://chromestatus.com/feature/5170190448852992)

Please note, that since profiling API is currently only implemented in Chromium-based browsers, the profiles collected will inherently be biased towards that demographic. This is something you'll need to consider if you're basing your decisions on the data collected. We hope that as the API gains adoption, other browsers will implement it as well. If you find the browser profiling feature helpful and would like to see it gain further adoption, please consider supporting the spec at the official [WICG repository](https://github.com/WICG/js-self-profiling).

To get started with JavaScript profiling, you'll need to:

- Install the @sentry/browser SDK
- Configure the document response header to include `Document-Policy: js-profiling`
- Configure the SDK to use the BrowserProfilingIntegration and set profilesSampleRate

## Step 1: Install the JavaScript Browser SDK

Install our JavaScript browser SDK using either `yarn` or `npm`, the minimum version that supports profiling is **7.60.0**.

## Step 2: Add Document-Policy: js-profiling header

For the JavaScript browser profiler to start, the document response header needs to include a `Document-Policy` header key with the `js-profiling` value.

How you do this will depend on your server. If you're using a server like Express, you'll be able to use the [response.set](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.set) function.

```js
app.get("/", (request, response) => {
  response.set("Document-Policy", "js-profiling");
  response.sendFile("index.html");
});
```

```csharp
// ASP.NET Core
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
    context.Response.OnStarting(() => {
        context.Response.Headers.Append("Document-Policy", "js-profiling");
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    });
    await next();
});
```

## Step 3: Configure the JavaScript SDK

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle. Once this is done, Sentry's JavaScript SDK will capture all unhandled exceptions and transactions.
