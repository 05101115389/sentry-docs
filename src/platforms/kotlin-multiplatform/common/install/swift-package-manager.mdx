<Note>We recommend you to use the Sentry Cocoa version 8.4.0 as we cannot guarantee correctness with other versions.</Note>

Open your iOS App in Xcode and open File > Add Packages. Then add the SDK by entering the git repo url in the top right search field:

```text
https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cocoa.git
```

Afterwards to install the Kotlin Multiplatform SDK and setup your Apple targets, you need to add the following to your `build.gradle.kts` file in your shared module:

```kotlin {filename:shared/build.gradle.kts}
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

kotlin {
  listOf(
    iosX64(),
    iosArm64(),
    iosSimulatorArm64()
  ).forEach {
    it.binaries.framework {
        baseName = "shared"
        isStatic = true // currently available only as static framework
    }
  }

  sourceSets {
    val commonMain by getting {
      dependencies {
        implementation("io.sentry:sentry-kotlin-multiplatform:{{@inject packages.version('sentry.kotlin.kmp', '0.0.1-alpha.2') }}")
      }
    }

    // Apple targets:
    val iosMain by getting {
      dependsOn(commonMain)
    }

    // Other targets...
  }
}
```
