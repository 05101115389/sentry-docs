To symbolicate your stacktraces, you need to provide debug information to Sentry.
The symbolication process unscrambles the stacktraces to reveal the function, file names, and line numbers of the crash.

## Apple

For Apple applications please follow the iOS documentation on [Uploading Debug Symbols](/platforms/apple/guides/ios/dsym) to set up debug symbols upload.

## Android

### Gradle

To upload ProGuard mapping files via Gradle you need to install the [Sentry Android Gradle](/platforms/android/gradle) plugin:

```kotlin {filename:androidApp/build.gradle.kts}
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral()
    }
}

plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
    id("io.sentry.android.gradle") version "{{@inject packages.version('sentry.java.android.gradle-plugin', '3.0.0') }}"
}

// Prevent Sentry from being included in the Android app through the AGP.
configurations {
    compileOnly {
        exclude(group = "io.sentry", module = "sentry")
        exclude(group = "io.sentry", module = "sentry-android")
    }
}
```

The plugin will automatically generate appropriate ProGuard mapping files and upload them when you run `gradle assemble{BuildVariant}` or `gradle assembleRelease`. Release is the default, but the plugin works for other variants if you have enabled ProGuard/R8. The credentials for the upload step are loaded through environment variables or from a `sentry.properties` file in your project root.

You will need to create a `sentry.properties` file:

```kotlin {filename:androidApp/sentry.properties}
defaults.project=___PROJECT_SLUG___
defaults.org=___ORG_SLUG___
auth.token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
```

If you are using the Guardsquare's ProGuard or DexGuard tooling, you have to enable the `experimentalGuardsquareSupport` flag.

### Sentry CLI

Alternatively, you can also use the Sentry CLI to upload ProGuard mapping files. You can find more information in the Sentry CLI docs for [Debug Information Files](/product/cli/dif/#proguard-mapping-upload).
