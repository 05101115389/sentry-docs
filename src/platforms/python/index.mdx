On this page, we get you up and running with Sentry's Python SDK.

## Install

Install our Python SDK using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```bash
pip install --upgrade sentry-sdk
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.
Once this is done, the SDK captures all unhandled exceptions and transactions.

<SignInNote />

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="___PUBLIC_DSN___",

    # Enable performance monitoring
    enable_tracing=True,
)
```

## Verify

This snippet includes an intentional error, so you can test that everything is working as soon as you set it up. To view and resolve the recorded error, log into [sentry.io](https://sentry.io) and open your project. Clicking on the error's title will open a page where you can see detailed information and mark it as resolved.

```py
division_by_zero = 1 / 0
```

Learn more about manually capturing an error or message in our <PlatformLink to="/usage/">Usage documentation</PlatformLink>.
