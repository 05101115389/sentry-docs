## Install

<PlatformContent includePath="common/getting-started/install" />


## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Add `use Sentry::Rack::CaptureExceptions` to your `config.ru` or other rackup file:

<SignInNote />

```ruby {filename:config.ru}
require 'sentry-ruby'

Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.breadcrumbs_logger = [:sentry_logger, :http_logger]

  # To activate performance monitoring, set one of these options.
  # We recommend adjusting the value in production:
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # or
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |context|
    true
  end
end

use Sentry::Rack::CaptureExceptions
```
