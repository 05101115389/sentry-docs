## Install

Add `sentry-ruby` and `sentry-rails` to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby {filename:Gemfile}
gem "sentry-ruby"
gem "sentry-rails"
```

## Configure

Configuration should happen as early as possible in your application's lifecycle.

Initialize the SDK within your `config/initializers/sentry.rb`:

<SignInNote />

```ruby {filename:config/initializers/sentry.rb}
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.dsn = '___PUBLIC_DSN___'
  config.breadcrumbs_logger = [:active_support_logger, :http_logger]

  # To activate performance monitoring, set one of these options.
  # We recommend adjusting the value in production:
  config.traces_sample_rate = 1.0
  # or
  config.traces_sampler = lambda do |context|
    true
  end
end
```
