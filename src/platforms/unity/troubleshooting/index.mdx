### Events marked as unhandled when calling `Debug.LogException`

Currenty, it is not possible for the SDK to distinguish between the user calling `Debug.LogException` and the SDK capturing an unhandled exception. To capture an exception and mark it as handled you can call `SentrySDK.CaptureException` instead.

### Universal Windows Platform - Events Not Sent

In order to send events to Sentry, you will need to activate the InternetClient Capability in your Player Settings.

### Mono JIT stack trace is incomplete on crashes

This is a [known limitation](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-unity/issues/884#issuecomment-1233035296) of the Mono JIT scripting backend, resulting from the native code not being able to see the actual generated code at the time of a crash. There are no debug files we can use to provide more information to stack traces since all code is generated when running the managed code. Using the IL2CPP scripting backend may provide more information, if that's an option for you.
